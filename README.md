# Password-Generator

## Description

The goal of this application was to create a password generator. As an employee with access to sensitive data, it is most vital that I have a strong, secure password. The password generator allows you to choose from certain character criteria and will spit out a password between the users choice of 8-128 characters.

During the development of this application, I learned how to use JavaScript. More specifically using functions and passing the values of those functions into another function. Array iteration and the Math.random() function were also learned.



## Installation
